# Geyser Timer Switch

I'm using the [Astute Smart Controller (ASC)](https://cbi-lowvoltage.co.za/astute) from [CBI-Electric](https://www.cbi-electric.co.za/)

The device runs on the [Tuya Smart IoT Platform](https://www.tuya.com/) so you can pair it with the Tuya app as apposed to the CBI branded app.

The auto pairing didn't work for me, so I had to put the device in AP (Access Point) mode. This feature is not documented, but I found a useful [post](https://powerforum.co.za/topic/7281-cbi-astute-smart-controller/page/4/#comment-100831) that describes the process.

- Hold the power button down for 5 seconds to put it in normal pairing mode
- Then hold the power button down again for 5 seconds to put it in AP pairing mode. The blue LED light will flash slowly
- Open the Tuya Smart application and manually add a device
- Select **Others** and then **Others (Wi-Fi)**

- For the prompts and the device will be added
- It will show up as ASC (Wi-Fi) but you can rename it to something else
